.TH ZFSWATCHER 8 "2013-02-18" "version 0.03"
.SH NAME
zfswatcher \- ZFS pool monitoring and notification daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zfswatcher
.RB [\| \-c
.IR config-file \|]
.RB [\| \-d \|]
.RB [\| \-P \|]
.RB [\| \-t \|]
.RB [\| \-v \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B zfswatcher
daemon periodically checks the ZFS pool status and sends notifications
about any changes according to the configuration settings. It also optionally
controls the disk enclosure LEDs and provides a web interface for viewing the
ZFS status and logs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-conf " \fIconfig-file\fR"
Use an alternate
.I config-file
instead of the default
.IR /etc/zfs/zfswatcher.conf .
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-debug
Enable debug mode which outputs all messages to STDOUT.
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \-\-passwordhash
Read a password and print a hashed password. This can be useful when
setting up the configuration files.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-test
Test the configuration file syntax and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH SIGNALS

.SH EXIT STATUS

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/zfs/zfswatcher.conf
Default configuration file.
.SH NOTES
The
.B zfswatcher
process does not "daemonize" itself (fork or double-fork to become a
background process) like most traditional Unix daemons do. This is a
modern approach and allows system process management daemons such as
.BR upstart (8)
and
.BR systemd (8)
to keep better control of the service. This can be worked around by
using a tool such as 
.BR start-stop-daemon (8).
.PP
Currently an external utility called
.B ledctl
which is part of the
.B ledmon
package is required for enclosure LED control.
