Obtaining the software
----------------------

Downloads and other information:

http://zfswatcher.damicon.fi/

Source repository:

https://github.com/damicon/zfswatcher/


Installing on Debian/Ubuntu
---------------------------

Download the .deb package and install it with `dpkg`, for example:

    dpkg -i zfswatcher_0.01-1_amd64.deb


Installing from source
----------------------

Generally it is best to use ready made packages on Debian/Ubuntu.

If you are packaging this software yourself or you want to compile
from source for other reasons, you can follow these instructions.


### Prerequisites

This software is implemented in Go programming language. Further
information about installing the Go environment is available
at the following URL:

http://golang.org/doc/install

The version 1.0.3 of the Go programming language on a 64 bit platform
is recommended.

The software has been developed on Debian 6.0 (squeeze) and Ubuntu 12.04
(precise) but it should work fine on other Linux distributions.

Minor modifications are currently required if running on other platforms.


### Compiling

Optionally edit the Makefile to set the installation directories.
Then run:

    make


### Installation

    make install


### Debian/Ubuntu packaging

The distribution comes with Debian style packaging in `/debian/`
subdirectory. A Debian package can be produced with the following
command:

    make deb

Note that the Go programming language environment needs to be correctly
installed even though it is not listed as a build dependency. This is
because the newest version of the Go language is not available in the
Debian/Ubuntu repositories.

The resulting .deb package file, for example `zfswatcher_0.01-1_amd64.deb`
is placed one directory level up from the source directory.


Configuration
-------------

Edit the configuration file:

    editor /etc/zfs/zfswatcher.conf

If you change the default web templates, it is best to copy them to
another location from `/usr/local/share/zfswatcher/www` and change
the `templatedir` and `resourcedir` settings in the configuration
accordingly. This way your local changes will not be overwritten if you
upgrade the zfswatcher package at a later time.

-------

tracker at:
