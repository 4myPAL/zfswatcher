Downloads and other information:

http://zfswatcher.damicon.fi/

Source repository:

https://github.com/damicon/zfswatcher/


Installing and upgrading on Debian/Ubuntu
-----------------------------------------

Download the .deb package and install it with `dpkg`, for example:

    dpkg -i zfswatcher_0.01-1_amd64.deb

The service is started by default according to the Debian and Ubuntu
conventions.


Installing and upgrading on RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux
--------------------------------------------------------

Download the .rpm package and install it with `yum`, for example:

    yum install zfswatcher-0.01-1.x86_64.rpm

The service is **not** started by default according to Red Hat
conventions. It can be started as follows:

    service zfswatcher start


Installing from source
----------------------

Generally it is best to use the ready made packages on Debian/Ubuntu
and RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux.

If you are packaging this software yourself or you want to compile
from source for other reasons, you can follow these instructions.


### Prerequisites

This software is implemented in Go programming language. Further
information about installing the Go environment is available
at the following URL:

http://golang.org/doc/install

The version 1.0.3 of the Go programming language on a 64 bit platform
is recommended.

The software has been developed on Debian 6.0 (squeeze) and Ubuntu 12.04
(precise) but it should work fine on other Linux distributions.

Minor modifications are currently required if running on other platforms.


### Compiling

Optionally edit the Makefile to set the installation directories.
Then run:

    make


### Installation

    make install


Configuration
-------------

Edit the configuration file:

    editor /etc/zfs/zfswatcher.conf

Verify the configuration syntax:

    zfswatcher -t

Restart the process:

    service zfswatcher restart

Some notes:

- See the configuration file comments for information about the configuration
  settings.

- Enclosure LED management is disabled by default. Currently an external
  utility `ledctl` (part of ledmon package) is required for this
  functionality.

- Logging to file `/var/log/zfswatcher.log` and local syslog daemon is enabled
  by default.

- E-mail notifications are disabled by default.

- The embedded web server is disabled by default.

- If you change the default web interface templates, it is best to copy them
  from `/usr/local/share/zfswatcher/www` to another location and change the
  `templatedir` and `resourcedir` settings in the configuration accordingly.
  This way your local changes will not be overwritten if you upgrade the
  package at a later time.
